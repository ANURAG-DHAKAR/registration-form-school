            <p>A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or more human
                occupants, and sometimes various companion animals. Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance
                rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene
                as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing.</p>

                introduced by his company Mattel on May 18, 1968.[1] It was the primary competitor of Matchbox until
                Mattel bought Matchbox owner Tyco Toys in 1997.</p>

            <p>A mobile phone or cell phone is a portable telephone that allows users to make and receive calls over a
                radio frequency link while moving within a designated telephone service area, unlike fixed-location
                phones (landline phones). This radio frequency link connects to the switching systems of a mobile phone
                operator, providing access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephony
                relies on a cellular network architecture, which is why mobile phones are often referred to as 'cell
                phones' in North America.</p>
